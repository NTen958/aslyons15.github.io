<p>Hello Im Ninah, Im 16 and I go to Oak Park and River Forest High School. I love FOOD a lot. I like to cook on my free time and for dinner for my family. I love animals especially Dogs and Birds! I have a French Bulldog, and a Blue and Gold Macaw. My favorite types of movies are Superheros (Marvels). When it comes to TV shows I like Comedys, Romace, Action, and Adventure.</p>
